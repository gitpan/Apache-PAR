Many things, including:
* More security testing
* Make it possible for other files to be loaded from within a .par archive by Registry and PerlRun scripts (without coding changes to the scripts?!)
* Make test work under mod_perl2 or if running as root
* Create base class for Apache::PAR::Static.pm (as a standalone CPAN module?) - support reading defaults from mod_dir
* Code cleanup
* Implement RegistryLoader
* New features...
