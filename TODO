Many things, including:
* Get Apache::PAR::Static to read defaults from mod_dir
* More security testing
* Make it possible for other files to be loaded from within a .par archive by Registry and PerlRun scripts (without coding changes to the scripts?!)
* Platform testing - currently only tested on x86 Linux, but should run on any platform that supports PAR.pm and Archive::Zip
* Support for Apache 2/mod_perl 2
