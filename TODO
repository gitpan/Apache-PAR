Many things, including:
* Get Apache::PAR::Static to read defaults from mod_dir
* More security testing
* Make it possible for other files to be loaded from within a .par archive by Registry and PerlRun scripts (without coding changes to the scripts?!)
* Platform testing - currently only tested on x86 Linux, but should run on any platform that supports PAR.pm and Archive::Zip
* Improve support for Apache 2/mod_perl 2
* Make test work under mod_perl2 or if running as root
* Create base class for Apache::PAR::Static.pm (as a standalone CPAN module?)
* Code cleanup
* Make it run under Module::Builder?
* Implement RegistryLoader
* New features...
