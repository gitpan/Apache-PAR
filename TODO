Many things, including:
* More security testing
* Make it possible for other files to be loaded from within a .par archive by Registry and PerlRun scripts (without coding changes to the scripts?!)
* Make test work under mod_perl2 or if running as root (waiting for Apache::Test to be release to CPAN)
* Improve caching support for Apache::PAR::Static - create ability to cache on server startup
* Implement RegistryLoader
* Implement a HTML::Template::PAR, others
* Redesign tests to generate par files, move contents to tmp directory if necessary
* New features...
